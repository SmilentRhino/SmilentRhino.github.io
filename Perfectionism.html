        <p>Perfectionism is not so perfect.</p>
<p>Although I like being a perfectionist, it still bothers me sometime. It
was a quite simple function that I would like to implement with django
framework. Instead of writing it directly, I searched a lot and read
quite a few documents to find the most reasonable way or the most
elegant way, which reasults in two days without a singe line of code. It
would be much easier if I could just let it go and comprise with my ugly
code. I just could not.</p>
<p>I think it is a neccesary part of the learning process, but it doesn't
look so well in work, which can be seen as a lack of efficiency.</p>
<p>So how do I overcome this? I should make a plan first, and set a time
frame for this, if no solution found on time, I should just move on and
give out the stupid solution first.</p>
<p>Sometimes I feel a little bit overwhelmed by all these emerging
technologies. Today they are hiring some one who knows about hadoop, the
other day they begin to want a sparks guy, then here comes docker, and
swarm and meos and kubernetes and nomad. Man, how can a person aquire so
many skills in one year or two, when everything change so fast. This
same thing also applies to programmers, one day they are arguing php is
the best language in the world, then it comes ruby, then js then go, it
never ends. Even if java happen to become the most popular language, the
framework are quickly evolving. I am afraid.</p>
<p>Slowly I begin to realize there is no real best practice, bash scripts,
python scripts, perl scripts, puppet, chef, all these can help us go
where we want, as long as one know how to use it. We don't need to use
certain tool to free us, to implement automation, though we still agree
that we should use the right tool for the right thing, it is not
neccesary. The boss won't care, HR won't care, PM won't care, only you
and your partner are hire to handle that.</p>
<p>What is ironic is that when it is necessary for an ops to have a really
broad knowledge, most company do require they have a deep understanding.
I am not saying this is impossible, but actually it takes time and
talants to be an expert, nobody can call himself a c++ master after ten
years of daily use, how can some one truly master so so so many tools?
Then how should we judge if a person is a good enough ops?</p>
