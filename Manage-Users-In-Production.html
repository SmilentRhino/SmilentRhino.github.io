        <p>Actually I have never thought about this before, which tool should we
use to manage users in production?</p>
<p><strong>Problem</strong></p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>During my short ops life, user management is always a pain as well
as assets management. Ops team don't know exactly how many servers
we have nor who are on this servers.</li>
<li>As a new member in the team, everytime I tried to solve a problem, I
would find I didn't have the permission. Sometimes the wiki,
sometimes nagios or zabbix. Not because my teamates don't trust me.
They just forget about them at all. We manage all those pemission
separately, in every tools we use.</li>
<li>In one of my ex-employers, it took half an hour to register me in
the system so that I can have access to the bastion server. Even for
security reason, I still think it unneccesary.</li>
<li>In another company, we used puppet to manage users in production,
but we had to go through all other internal services when one
employee left for any reason. This whole process was boring and
error-prone. Even after the staff had gone for months, we sometimes
could still find him/her on one server or another. Not untill we did
a massive recheck could we find that out.</li>
<li>Some of my friends said they now use ansible to manage access on aws
ec2. It is no less time consuming and error prone, in such an
enviroment when people come on board in the morning and leave for
better opportunity in the afternoon.</li>
<li>I have been thinking about this for a while, and thought maybe we
need a web server to do central authentication, generator dynamic
state files or manifests, and use puppet or salt to manange them.
But maybe I was totally wrong.</li>
<li>Do I know about LDAP, of course I do, do we used this in office, the
answer is yes. Have I manage or control it, no. Why haven't I
thought about it before, I did, but I never do any test to verify my
assumption, nor do I know any person do this. I have never ask them
why they prefer to do this but not that, why puppet not ldap.</li>
<li>We do separate production from office network, right, so how should
ldap work properly here?</li>
<li>By the way when it comes to store sensitive private keys or secrets,
Vault seems to be a good solution, only it seems to be a little two
complicated.</li>
<li>Wait a minute, how come I forget the SSO solution, how about combine
the open source CAS with this.
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/apereo/cas">CAS</a></li>
<li>I saw so few articles discuss about this, how come it become a lost
art?</li>

</ol>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Nearly all authentication backend support ldap, or use ldap as backend.
So it is still the first choice. Almost all other open source software
we use in daily operation support integrate with it. And we should
manage it with configuration management tool for backup and version
control. Vault will be a good plus for authentication management in
cloud or situation with high security requirement.</p>
