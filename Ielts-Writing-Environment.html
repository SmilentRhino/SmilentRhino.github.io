        <p>My eighth ietls writing practice.</p>
<p><strong>Nowadays both scientists and tourists can go to remote natural
environments such as the South Pole. Do you think the advantages of this
development outweigh the disadvantages?</strong></p>
<p><em>Ideas</em></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Human activity damaged the environment, that there was a civic duty
to maintain the environment for future generations.</li>
<li>These scientific research will help us better understand our world,
thus better protect them.</li>
<li>This unexplored placed are dangerous.</li>
<li>Tourists can experience an extraordinary side of nature</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Positive impacts of tourism</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Jobs for local people</li>
<li>Income for the local economy</li>
<li>Helps preserve rural services like buses, village shops and post
offices</li>
<li>Increased demand for local food and crafts</li>
<li>Tourists mainly come to see the scenery and wildlife, so there is
pressure to conserve habitats and wildlife</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Negative impacts of tourism</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Damage to the landscape: litter, erosion, fires, disturbance to
livestock, vandalism</li>
<li>Traffic congestion and pollution</li>
<li>Local goods can become expensive because tourists will pay more</li>
<li>Shops stock products for tourists and not everyday goods needed by
locals</li>
<li>Demand for holiday homes makes housing too expensive for local people</li>
<li>Demand for development of more shops and hotels</li>
<li>Jobs are mainly seasonal, low paid with long hours</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>My Essay 1</strong></p>
<p>Some nature environments used to be uncharted and inaccessible such as
the North Pole or antarctic are now frequectly visited by tourists for
entertainment as well as scientists for study. Exposed to a rapid
growing human presentence, some people worry that the unique
biodiversity of these places are under great threat. In my opinion, as
long as reasonable supervision are provided, this is still an exiting
development we should welcome.</p>
<p>Admittedly, excessive human activities might bring risks to the
environment. First, introduced species might have a negative impact on
the ecosystem of these regions, or even totally destory it. Delibrately
or not, new species introduced to these unique ecosystem could cause
worse concequence than we expected. What's more, it is difficult to deal
with the waste produced in these areas, while degration process of
pollutions and waste are much more slower due to the low temperature.
Therefore, stricter control should be placed on what is permitted to
brought there and better pollution management is also needed.</p>
<p>However, leaving such environments alone will not really save them.
Researches conducted in these area provide us a chance to better
understand how the ecosystem works, which futher help us better protect
it. For example, we have seen a decrease of antarctic sea ice in last
decade caused by global warming. Through the study of these places,
people could gain a better understanding of what is going on and adopt
policies to tackle the problem.</p>
<p>In conclusion, exploration of remote nature places offer us some unique
experiences and knowledge, and help use better protect these
environments, provided we take mesures to control exceeded pollution.</p>
<p><strong>Useful Sentences</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Negative effects of tourism include increased pollution, an increased
carbon footprint and the stress placed on the native plants, animals
and ecosystems. Positive benefits of tourism include increased
awareness of the plight of many species and increase in capital that
flows into conservation organizations.</li>
<li>Antarctica is a continent for science, as it is so unspoiled it acts
as a laboratory for the rest of the world where changes can be
measured in isolation from the effects of man. It is crucial for
instance in helping us to understand the effects of global warming
including using ice cores going back hundreds of thousands of years
from the ice cap which is up to 4km thick</li>
<li>They set off into the country's uncharted interior.</li>
<li>Parts of the forest are still dense and inaccessible.</li>
<li>Nude bathing is technically illegal but there are plenty of unspoilt
beaches where no one would ever know.</li>
<li>The scientist has spent six months in the solitudes of the Antarctic.</li>
<li>Vast areas are arid or semi - desert, and virtually uninhabited.</li>
<li>In his escape, he walked six days in the midst of howling wilderness.</li>
<li>The motif of these volumes is that &quot;solitude is the richness of the
soul, loneliness is its poverty.&quot;</li>
<li>Solitude was no excuse for sloppiness.</li>
<li>They often have a lonely and solitary life to lead.</li>
<li>Witness an array of wildlife like no other on Earth, and explore the
Pacific islands’ breathtaking, untraversed landscapes.</li>
<li>Inhospitable environments and devastating natural forces that make
some places least explored. On the other hand, it’s a blessing.
Because, it help to keep even a few places in its original form.</li>
<li>Antarctica faces growing threats from global warming, loss of sea ice
and landed ice, increased tourism, over-fishing in the region,
pollution and invasive species creeping into the area.</li>
