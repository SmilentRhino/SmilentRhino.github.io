        <p>The fifth practice is about neighbors.</p>
<p><strong>In many cities, an increasing number of people do not know their
neighbours and the sense of community is lost. Discuss the causes and
give measures to turn it around.</strong></p>
<p><strong>My Essay1</strong></p>
<p>People in urban areas seem to be more isolated nowadays than the older
generations. Advanced technology and culture diversity are the two main
causes for this phenomenon, we can encourge more community activities to
reconnect people in the neighborhood.</p>
<p>First, new technology such as internet and smart phones enable us be
less rely on our neighbors. People don not ask their neighbors to take
care of their children or pets recently as there are plenty of
professionals in the marked to provide this kind of services, just one
click on the smart phone, one will get all things done. And we connect
with our extensive family members, friends and collegues conviniently on
social network websites, which makes a communication with the people
live next door unneccessary.</p>
<p>Even if we want to reach out to people live in the same condo, we would
usually hesitate because we lack of trust in the community, especially
with people from different backgrounds, different culture. It common to
move around in the big cities, people move frequently due to job change,
new relationship, or finacial reason. That is why our neighbor in the
same building came from different places or even different countries.
People are often too shy to start the conversation , at least not that
comfortable to do so.</p>
<p>Public facilities like garden or library provide neighbors a chance to
know about each other. People are more likely to have a small
conversation when they walk the pets or play with the children. Reading
the same book or working in the same gym also give people a common
topic, we like to share knowledge and experience.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we can encourage and engage more in community events to
know our neighbor, it is nice to have a warm neighborhood.</p>
<p><strong>Useful sentences</strong></p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><strong>Social alienation</strong>, a sociological concept developed by several
classical and contemporary theorists, is &quot;a condition in social
relationships reflected by a low degree of integration or common
values and a high degree of distance or isolation between
individuals, or between an individual and a group of people in a
community or work environment&quot;. The concept has many
discipline-specific uses, and can refer both to a personal
psychological state (subjectively) and to a type of social
relationship (objectively).</li>
<li><strong>Parental alienation</strong> is the process, and the result, of the
psychological manipulation of a child into showing unwarranted fear,
disrespect or hostility towards a parent and/or other family
members.It is a distinctive and widespread form of psychological
abuse and family violence—towards both the child and the rejected
family members—that occurs almost exclusively in association with
family separation or divorce (particularly where legal action is
involved) and that undermines core principles of both the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights and the United Nations Convention on the
Rights of the Child. Most commonly, the primary cause is a parent
wishing to exclude another parent from the life of their child, but
other family members or friends, as well as professionals involved
with the family (including psychologists, lawyers and judges), may
contribute significantly to the process.It often leads to the
long-term, or even permanent, estrangement of a child from one parent
and other family members and, as a particularly adverse childhood
experience, results in significantly increased risks of both mental
and physical illness for children.</li>
