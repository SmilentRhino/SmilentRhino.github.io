<p><strong>Many museums and historical sites are mainly visited by tourists, not
local people. Why is this the case? What can be done to attract local
people?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Ideas</strong></p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Local people have been there once.</li>
<li>Visitors are more attractive to a new culture.</li>
<li>Local people don't have enough motivation, they think they can go
there any time.</li>
<li>Most museums are targeted at more generous foreign tourists.</li>
<li>A year membership to local residents.</li>
<li>Special exhibits, tours and workshops for kids.</li>
<li>Borrow items from other museums to lure local people.</li>
<li>Price of the entrance ticket is often too high for local inhabitants
to affod.</li>
<li>Local people are busy compared with tourists from tourists.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>My Essay 1</strong></p>
<p>Compared with the enthusiastic tourists, local people seem to show
indifference to place of interests in their hometown despite the
convinience and relative lower cost. This essay will examine the reasons
for this before suggesting some possible methods of attracting local
people.</p>
<p>Firstly, while visitors are driven by curiosity about a different
culture, local peole lack this kind of motivations. Local people are
familiar with the history either through their textbooks or from the
story their family tell, thus they are unlikely to gain the exotic
experience and feel as thrilled as the tourists do. Secondly, tourists
from all over the world set aside time and save money for the visits
they could pay only once in a lifetime, local citizens don't want to
spend too much time or money on such activies which they can do anytime
in their life, even thought the cost is relatively much lower.</p>
<p>However, it doesn't mean museums and historical sites are of no
interests and not important to local people. Rotating exhibitions of
borrowed items from other museums are a huge draw for local people.
Another way is to offer more special exhibits, tours and workshops for
kids, parents who are eager to enrich their children's life always would
not hesitate to pay a visit. It's also a great way to strengthen family
bonds and build community culture.</p>
<p>In conclusion, diffrent motivations are the major factor why tourists
are more willing to visist historical places and museums. Cooporation
between museums and special culture events can help to promote
attendance of native residents.</p>
