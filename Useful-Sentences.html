        <p>Some useful sentences I recorded on xmind, not easy to read, move them
here.</p>
<p><strong>Color</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>I don't really associate any general colors with moods. I tend to
think of soft or pale colors as quiet or soothing, whether they are
red, blue, brown, or grey. And I tend to think of strong, saturated
colors as energetic, again, independent of hue.<ul>
<li>Orange: Extroverted, fearless, delirious, jeering, reckless.</li>
<li>Yellow: Defensive, hypercritical, sarcastic, demoralized, cynical.</li>
<li>Green: Creative, enthusiastic, suggestible, energetic, erotic.</li>
<li>Blue: Idealistic, sincere, romantic, generous, trusting.</li>
<li>Purple: Introverted, meditative, quizzical, ambivalent,
empathetic.</li>
<li>White: Anxious, despondent, pessimistic, nervous, bleak.</li>
<li>Black: Determined, principled, independent, stoic, severe.</li>
<li>Grey: Disinterested, philosophical, cautious, brooding, calm.</li>
<li>Brown: Gregarious, egalitarian, affectionate, humorous, cheerful</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I don't associate colors with moods, other than the popular notions
like blue for depression, red with angry, yellow with cowardly</li>
<li>An orange sky in the evening seems gloomy to me, a dark grey sky
filled with rain clouds looks ominous to me. A bright blue sky is
cheerful. Interestingly, a reddish sky at night makes me a bit
uncomfortable, but a pitch black sky has no effect.</li>
<li>Red is a very emotionally intense color. It enhances human
metabolism, increases respiration rate, and raises blood pressure. It
has very high visibility, which is why stop signs, stoplights, and
fire equipment are usually painted red. In heraldry, red is used to
indicate courage. It is a color found in many national flags.</li>
<li>Orange combines the energy of red and the happiness of yellow. It is
associated with joy, sunshine, and the tropics. Orange represents
enthusiasm, fascination, happiness, creativity, determination,
attraction, success, encouragement, and stimulation.</li>
<li>Yellow produces a warming effect, arouses cheerfulness, stimulates
mental activity, and generates muscle energy. Yellow is often
associated with food. Bright, pure yellow is an attention getter,
which is the reason taxicabs are painted this color. When overused,
yellow may have a disturbing effect; it is known that babies cry more
in yellow rooms. Yellow is seen before other colors when placed
against black; this combination is often used to issue a warning. In
heraldry, yellow indicates honor and loyalty. Later the meaning of
yellow was connected with cowardice.</li>
<li>Use yellow to evoke pleasant, cheerful feelings. You can choose
yellow to promote children's products and items related to leisure.
Yellow is very effective for attracting attention, so use it to
highlight the most important elements of your design. Men usually
perceive yellow as a very lighthearted, 'childish' color, so it is
not recommended to use yellow when selling prestigious, expensive
products to men – nobody will buy a yellow business suit or a yellow
Mercedes. Yellow is an unstable and spontaneous color, so avoid using
yellow if you want to suggest stability and safety. Light yellow
tends to disappear into white, so it usually needs a dark color to
highlight it. Shades of yellow are visually unappealing because they
loose cheerfulness and become dingy.</li>
<li>Green is the color of nature. It symbolizes growth, harmony,
freshness, and fertility. Green has strong emotional correspondence
with safety. Dark green is also commonly associated with money. Green
has great healing power. It is the most restful color for the human
eye; it can improve vision. Green suggests stability and endurance.
Sometimes green denotes lack of experience; for example, a
'greenhorn' is a novice. In heraldry, green indicates growth and
hope. Green, as opposed to red, means safety; it is the color of free
passage in road traffic. Use green to indicate safety when
advertising drugs and medical products. Green is directly related to
nature, so you can use it to promote 'green' products. Dull, darker
green is commonly associated with money, the financial world,
banking, and Wall Street.</li>
<li>Blue is the color of the sky and sea. It is often associated with
depth and stability. It symbolizes trust, loyalty, wisdom,
confidence, intelligence, faith , truth, and heaven. Blue is
considered beneficial to the mind and body. It slows human metabolism
and produces a calming effect. Blue is strongly associated with
tranquility and calmness. In heraldry, blue is used to symbolize
piety and sincerity. You can use blue to promote products and
services related to cleanliness (water purification filters, cleaning
liquids, vodka), air and sky (airlines, airports, air conditioners),
water and sea (sea voyages, mineral water). As opposed to emotionally
warm colors like red, orange, and yellow; blue is linked to
consciousness and intellect. Use blue to suggest precision when
promoting high-tech products. Blue is a masculine color; according to
studies, it is highly accepted among males. Dark blue is associated
with depth, expertise, and stability; it is a preferred color for
corporate America. Avoid using blue when promoting food and cooking,
because blue suppresses appetite. When used together with warm colors
like yellow or red, blue can create high-impact, vibrant designs; for
example, blue-yellow-red is a perfect color scheme for a superhero</li>
<li>Purple combines the stability of blue and the energy of red. Purple
is associated with royalty. It symbolizes power, nobility, luxury,
and ambition. It conveys wealth and extravagance. Purple is
associated with wisdom, dignity, independence, creativity, mystery,
and magic. According to surveys, almost 75 percent of pre-adolescent
children prefer purple to all other colors. Purple is a very rare
color in nature; some people consider it to be artificial. Light
purple is a good choice for a feminine design. You can use bright
purple when promoting children's products.</li>
<li>Black is associated with power, elegance, formality, death, evil, and
mystery. Black is a mysterious color associated with fear and the
unknown (black holes). It usually has a negative connotation
(blacklist, black humor, 'black death'). Black denotes strength and
authority; it is considered to be a very formal, elegant, and
prestigious color (black tie, black Mercedes). In heraldry, black is
the symbol of grief. Black gives the feeling of perspective and
depth, but a black background diminishes readability. A black suit or
dress can make you look thinner. When designing for a gallery of art
or photography, you can use a black or gray background to make the
other colors stand out. Black contrasts well with bright colors.
Combined with red or orange – other very powerful colors – black
gives a very aggressive color scheme</li>
<li>White is associated with light, goodness, innocence, purity, and
virginity. It is considered to be the color of perfection. White
means safety, purity, and cleanliness. As opposed to black, white
usually has a positive connotation. White can represent a successful
beginning. In heraldry, white depicts faith and purity. In
advertising, white is associated with coolness and cleanliness
because it's the color of snow. You can use white to suggest
simplicity in high-tech products. White is an appropriate color for
charitable organizations; angels are usually imagined wearing white
clothes. White is associated with hospitals, doctors, and sterility,
so you can use white to suggest safety when promoting medical
products. White is often associated with low weight, low-fat food,
and dairy products</li>
<li>I am a Late Nighter. I generally sleep around 4.30 or so. Morning- In
morning I'm like too grumpy, grouchy and very difficult to handle. I
feel too lethargic and don't feel like talking to anyone. It's the
worse like to mess with me. Afternoon- It is the afternoon when my
mind starts to work. I usually think of my future plan during boring
lectures and sometime regret on things that i have done wrong. I feel
numb sometimes. Night- Its the best part of my day. I feel so lively,
happy and beaming. Actually for me, my day starts at night. I do all
my productive work along with soft music.</li>
<li>There's a lot going on in my life right now and so I experience
terrible mood swings these days.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>In conclusion, the disadvantages of an admission fee are overshadowed
by the benefits accruing from a stable source of income. Therefore,
having weighed up the pros and cons, I am convinced that museums
should charge an entrance fee for the sake of operation and
development.</li>

<p><strong>Climate Change</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Habitat fragmentation may occur naturally or as a result of humans.
Naturally, glaciers, volcanic activity, plate tectonic movements,
rise in sea level and climate change can all cause habitats to become
fragmented and disjointed.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Charity</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>This information can impact a charity's reputation with donors and
societies, and thus, the charity's financial gains. But sometimes,
our donations are wasted through poor management or, worse, fraud.
When that happens, everybody loses: The needy are deprived of funds
that otherwise would have helped them, the government misses out on
money that should have been taxed, legitimate charities are bypassed,
and donors become hesitant to give. Outreach International is a
humanitarian organization that works in communities to eradicate the
world’s deepest poverty. When individuals and families gain
confidence through a process of identifying their own problems and
implementing their own solutions, they break the multi-generational
cycle of poverty. With your support and their hard work, they can
change the fates of their families and neighbors for generations.
Outreach International was founded more than 30 years ago, when
Charles Neff, a member of the Community of Christ church, traveled to
an impoverished community in the Philippines and recognized the
destitution; but also the despair that infused those men, women, and
children. Today, Outreach is a multinational organization, leading
thousands of families to clean water, schools, food, infrastructure,
sanitation, electricity, and, most importantly, hope. We do not
discriminate based on race, religion, ethnicity, or gender.
Investment in People We believe in the inherent worth of all people
and strive to help them find their inherent dignity. We stand in
solidarity with those suffering the injustices of poverty. We
exclusively work in ways that respect the values, culture, and
spirituality of each community.</li>
<li>The prime purpose of the International Day of Charity is to raise
awareness and provide a common platform for charity related
activities all over the world for individuals, charitable,
philanthropic and volunteer organizations for their own purposes on
the local, national, regional and international level.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Social Network</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Social networking sites play a pivotal role in mitigating
communication gap not only in the immediate social circle but also
with friends and families in remote areas by sharing their news and
updates.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Study</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>A satellite campus or branch campus is a campus of a college or
university that is physically at a distance from the original
university or college area.</li>
<li>Three years after we graduated, we organized a reunion.</li>
<li>A class reunion is a meeting of former classmates, most often
organized at or near their former school by one or a group of the
class members on or around an anniversary of their graduation, e.g. 5
years later. Former teachers may be invited as well. They reminisce
about their school days and bring each other up to date on what has
happened since they went their separate ways. Some class reunions
also include a reunion class gift to the institution.</li>
<li>Alumni are quite often concerned about how their lives have turned
out when compared with the lives of their former classmates, and will
sometimes feel pressured enough to go to great lengths to concoct
stories about their fruitful careers, personal accomplishments, and
relationships with others.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Globalisation</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Advances in transportation (such as the steam locomotive, steamship,
jet engine, and container ships) and in telecommunications
infrastructure (including the rise of the telegraph and its modern
offspring, the Internet, and mobile phones) have been major factors
in globalization, generating further interdependence of economic and
cultural activities.</li>
<li>Globalization or globalisation (see spelling differences) is the
process of international integration arising from the interchange of
world views, products, ideas, and other aspects of culture. Economic
globalization is the increasing economic interdependence of national
economies across the world through a rapid increase in cross-border
movement of goods, services, technology, and capital</li>
<li>Cultural globalization refers to the transmission of ideas, meanings,
and values around the world in such a way as to extend and intensify
social relations The diffusion of certain cuisines such as American
fast food chains is a visible aspect of cultural globalization.</li>
<li>Supranational institutions such as the European Union, the WTO, the
G8 or the International Criminal Court replace or extend national
functions to facilitate international agreement.</li>
<li>In light of the economic gap between rich and poor countries,
movement adherents claim &quot;free trade&quot; without measures in place to
protect the under-capitalized will contribute only to the
strengthening the power of industrialized nations (often termed the
&quot;North&quot; in opposition to the developing world's &quot;South&quot;).
Globalization is restructuring control over resources in such a way
that the natural resources of the poor are systematically taken over
by the rich and the pollution promulgated by the rich is
systematically dumped on the poor.[161] For example, 90 percent of
historic carbon dioxide emissions have been by the industrialized
countries. The developed countries produce 90 percent of the
hazardous wastes produced around the world every year. Global free
trade has globalized this environmental destruction in an asymmetric
pattern. Some argue the economy is controlled by Northern
corporations and they are increasingly exploiting resources of less
wealthy countries for their global activities while it is the South
that is disproportionately bearing the environmental burden of the
globalized economy. Globalization is thus leading to a type of
environmental apartheid.</li>
<li>Globalization's advocates say that free trade and free markets don't
dilute or pollute other cultures, they enhance them. Trade creates
wealth, they say. Wealth frees the world's poorest people from the
daily struggle for survival, and allows them to embrace, celebrate
and share the art, music, crafts and literature that might otherwise
have been sacrificed to poverty.</li>
<li>Another alternative perspective argues ] that in reaction to the
process of cultural globalization, a &quot;Clash of Civilizations&quot; might
appear. Indeed, Samuel Huntington emphasizes the fact that while the
world is becoming smaller and interconnected, [the interactions
between peoples of different cultures enhance the civilization
consciousness that in turn invigorate differences]. Indeed, rather
than reaching a global cultural community, the differences in culture
sharpened by this very process of cultural globalization will be a
source of conflict. While not many commentators agree that this
should be characterized as a 'Clash of Civilizations', there is
general concurrence that cultural globalization is an ambivalent
process bringing an intense sense of local difference and ideological
contestation.</li>
<li>Against this backdrop the seemingly unstoppable and ever accelerating
cultural homogenization around the world brought about by travel, the
internet and social networking, although often decried, is probably a
good thing even if it means the loss of cultural diversity: it
increases our sense of togetherness via the sense of a shared
culture. In fact, breaking down of cultural barriers – unfashionable
as this can sound – is probably one of the few things that societies
can do to increase harmony among ever more heterogeneous peoples.</li>

<p><strong>Weather</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>It’s quite changeable really … we have periods of time with clear
blue skies then all of a sudden we’ll have torrential rain.</li>
<li>Well … I suppose it’s a matter of personal taste really … I like it
around the end of October and November … I’m not fond of the
heatwaves we often get during the summer … it’s not freezing cold
during these months and we still get lots of sunny spells.</li>
<li>It depends … if I get caught in the rain and I get drenched I don’t
like it … but I’m a gardener so a drop of rain is good for myplants.</li>
<li>It often drizzles in the morning.</li>
<li>I like rainy weather. When it pours down, we sit at home with my
family, talk and drink hot tea. In my country the climate is
generally cold and humid, especially in the north</li>
<li>Continental climate implies hot summers and frosty winters.</li>
<li>I don’t like winters because of frequent snowstorms.</li>
<li>After the hail, we found hailstones that were the size of golf balls!</li>
<li>In the autumn strong winds are quite frequent.</li>
<li>I don’t usually like windy weather, but a light breeze from the ocean
makes me happy.</li>
<li>The last summer was boiling hot, the average temperature reached 40
degrees!</li>
<li>The weather in my country is mild in spring</li>
<li>It's chilly today, so I think you should wear a coat.</li>
<li>In the autumn, the average temperature here is 15 degrees Celsius</li>
<li>The temperature often goes below zero in the winter.</li>
<li>Personally, I don’t like gloomy weather. It makes me feel depressed.</li>
<li>I adore clear weather, when there are no clouds on the sky.</li>
<li>After a long rain, it finally cleared up.</li>
<li>I forgot to take an umbrella and was drenched in the rain.</li>
<li>Although the forecasts predicted a mild winter, the January was
freezing cold.</li>
<li>My town is so polluted that I don’t see stars at night because of
thick smog!</li>
<li>When we have a heatwave in the summer, which sometimes can be for
weeks on end , I love to go down to the coast where you can cool off
in the sea or just enjoy the cool breeze coming off the sea.</li>
<li>I think having four very different seasons, as we do in the UK, is a
good thing because it’s amazing to see how the countryside changes
with the seasons</li>
<li>I think I would find it very strange to live near the equator where
the weather is pretty much the same all year round.</li>
<li>I’d say that my favourite season of the year is spring[12] because
after a long cold winter the first signs of spring really lift your
spirits</li>
<li>The rain does sometimes get me down especially if it continues for
weeks without stopping and it often makes me feel reluctant to leave
the house.</li>
<li>One thing that I like about the British weather is that we don’t
really get extremes of temperature[10] as some other countries do.</li>
<li>Tao, a finance major, had a simple breakfast of bread and porridge to
fortify her for a long day of standing at attention in the sweltering
August heat, singing &quot;Unity Is Strength&quot; and other military anthems,

</ul>
<p><strong>Music</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">

<li>I think I’m a bit tone deaf so perhaps I’d find it hard</li>
<li>I’m really into live music I go to a lot of music festivals</li>
<li>I think a live performance always sounds more exciting than a
recorded version</li>
<li>they had a huge following</li>
<li>one piece of music in particular is called ‘Slipping through my
fingers’</li>
<li>it wasn’t a massive hit but I love it</li>
<li>like a lot of their songs it’s a very catchy tune</li>
<li>it’s the kind of music you can also sing along to easily</li>
<li>On the one hand it’s good for marketing new musical talent or
particular bands but it’s so easy to share and download tracks for
free I think it is costing the industry a lot of money …</li>
<li>I do think they should be encouraged to play instruments and to play
things by ear</li>
<li>perhaps at concerts when a band goes on tour</li>
<li>I just plug in my ipod and tune in to my favourite collection of

<li>The music is heart soothing and you always love to listen to their
music.</li>
<li>When I hear a song that I love for the first time, it’s one of the
best feelings in the world. But every time after that first time you
think of that first time and wish you could go back to that moment.</li>
<li>Honestly, I would give anything to go back to the first time I heard
those 4 songs and feel the impact they made on my life in just a
short 3-5 minutes. When those songs come on my iPod when it’s on
shuffle, the biggest grin comes on my face because of those precious,
once in a lifetime memories they’ve made.</li>
<li>This song made me admire the lyrics used in a song and learn to
dissect a song’s true meaning. It also made me respect the punny and
clever lyrics that this age of artists has made a fine art with their
pens and pencils.</li>
<li>If you haven’t checked it out, then it’s a must hear for any fan of
music; the second verse is great but the third verse is one of the
best I’ve ever heard.</li>
<li>This is the most emotional song for me, out of any song I’ve heard.
The first time I heard it, I cried.</li>
<li>When I got the album, The Heist, I listened to it all the way through
with no interruptions, but the next day at school during Newspaper
first period I listened to this song on a loop.</li>
<li>I was totally entranced by the sound of this song. It sounds almost
sad, but it's not. It always feels ambiguous, I never understand what
I'm supposed to feel when I listen to it, but I love it.</li>
<li>This song is incredible! The video makes me wish I could dance.</li>
<li>It only took me one listen to fall in love with their sound</li>
<li>And then the drums kicked in. I was hooked in an instant. The song
kept churning and wailing on, but the moment that I went from really
liking the song to loving it was the bridge at 2:25 where it goes
&quot;Well don't it make you feel bad when you're try'na find your way
home, you don't know which way to go? If ya goin' down south they got
no work to do, if you don't know 'bout Chicago&quot; It just blew me away</li>
<li>I often find myself disappointed with live versions, but this was
really good. The audio quality is reasonable and they managed to
sound really close to the album.</li>
<li>I think the chorus is just too catchy, yet so simple, I couldn't help
but loving it</li>
<li>Listened to it on repeat for over a week.</li>
<li>This song has so much background atmosphere, but you can clearly hear
the strumming of the guitars throughout which makes it a beautiful
mix of the recognizable and unfamiliar. It's strange, because you
know that they are obviously guitars playing, but it sounds like so
much more than just that.</li>
<li>This is the place where your song can either distinguish itself as a
great composition, or fall flat into mediocrity.</li>
<li>I use this for my alarm clock. It starts so subtle and builds so
slowly that is perfect for coaxing me out of bed. Hostile alarms that
jar me out of bed don't work well, I just rush to turn it off and go
right back to sleep. Something like this gradually wakes me up and
pulls out of bed because I get into the song and I'm sucked into it,
instead of wanting it to end as fast as possible.</li>
<li>It was one of the most difficult Summer's of my life when that song
came out and it hit me so hard. Not necessarily 100% in terms of
lyrics, but the burst of energy the song emits. It's still to this
day one of my favorite songs by them and I can't wait to hear it live
this tour. The energy, passion, and guitars in it are just so
uplifting and makes me very happy.</li>
<li>What's the best opening track ever?</li>
<li>Although there are a lot of great songs that have great intros, in
certain cases, the opening bars of a track become so instantly
recognisable and iconic that they transcend the song that spawned
them.</li>
<li>There's no magical arrangement work going on here: just the piano and
bass playing the same, timeless riff; the guitar holding station on a
single, chugging note; and, on the second pass through, some spritely
strings. No, in this case it's all about the quality of the hook -
which is musically simple but impeccably timed - and the instant,
certain knowledge that this is a groove that you're going to get
along with. In fact, the first 30 seconds alone confirm why I Want
You Back is regarded as one of the greatest pop records in history.</li>
<li>Whatever it is, the opening to A Hard Day’s Night is easily the most
discussed first chord to anything, ever. Musicologists have pored
over it in more depth that you’d have thought possible, but whoever
was playing what and how, the iconic jangle of 12-string
Rickenbacker, bass, piano and acoustic guitar announced the onset of
The Beatles' imperial period. A Hard Day’s Night cemented the band's
position as America’s favourite, and that impossible intro has since
passed into legend.</li>
<li>Three notes. That's all it takes to know that you're about to be
treated to Marvin's most lustful five minutes. Some great song intros
are long and complex, but in this case, a simple,
blink-and-you'll-miss-it wah guitar motif is all that's required.</li>
<li>From the revving engine rumble of Vinnie “Mad Dog” Lopez’s drums to
the very last tap on the glockenspiel, it’s one of rock’s most
exhilarating 14 seconds.</li>

<p><strong>Crime</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>youth crime</li>
<li>juvenile delinquency</li>
<li>Because the development of delinquency in youth is influenced by
numerous factors, prevention efforts need to be comprehensive in
scope</li>
<li>juvenile offending</li>
<li>juvenile males contribute to the majority of sex crimes</li>
<li>Income Inequality as Determinant of Crime Rate</li>
<li>Wealth Gaps and Crime Rate</li>
<li>Where income inequality is concerned, efforts at reducing income gap
will provide the long-term solutions to the crime problem, both
within the poor and unsecured neighborhoods as well as to crimes
targeted at richer residents.</li>
<li>Likewise, the consistency displayed by income inequality and crime
rate levels show that people and places considered as lower in
economic and social class have higher crime rates than wealthier
groups.</li>
<li>Regionalism is a major cause of crime and unrest among people. Such
people that harbor such regionalist feelings often go to great
lengths to commit crimes against other communities. This fact is
often ignored by people and the administrative bodies as they too are
caught up in classifications of people by region. It is often that a
victim of such regionalism gets influenced and enters the world of
crimes</li>
<li>TV violence has gone up to staggering levels and it does not help
when people are influenced and try to emulate such acts of violence.
TV violence is a major cause of crime especially among younger people
that are unable to differentiate between fiction and reality. Since
TV has become such an integral part of people’s lives now days, it is
important to draw clear lines between what is real and what is not.</li>
<li>Discrimination based on race is a serious issue all around the world.
All humans are in a way racist towards some people in some part of
the world or another. Racism has contributed a lot of unrest to many
places all around the world and it’s mostly because of one or two
idiots that such crimes are given birth to. It is a sad fact of the
world that we live in that we end up discriminating against something
that is the same flesh and blood underneath even though the external
appearance and the origins may be different</li>
<li>Increase in population is the biggest cause of crime and much of the
world’s worries. Although population increase is related to each and
every cause mentioned here, it still needs to be looked at as a cause
of crime. The increase of population triggers of a dynamo effect in
society and this leads to the creation of more people with some form
of frustration or resentment towards society as such. Economic
deprivation or simply poverty is a major cause of crime all around
the world. People are often driven to great lengths of desperation by
poverty and this is a major cause of crime all around the world. The
fact that such frustration is created is in itself a very dangerous
thing for society on the whole as global inflation has risen
significantly over the last few years. Although it does seem that in
our world today, the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.</li>
<li>Politics is often a cause of crime. It is seen that many political
associations all around the world have their own mafias running which
they use to manipulate and subjugate people. Political power is often
misused to take advantage of weaker groups and people and the
dissidence that rises out of such situations often force the victims
to resort to crimes. Politics is more related to crime on a much
larger and a much heinous level than anything else.</li>
<li>Controversial topics include media violence research and effects of
gun politics.</li>

save for a few pedestrians briskly walking through the street, most

<li>The highest-level air pollution warning was given the evening before,
triggered by three forecasted days of severe haze.</li>
<li>According to Greenpeace, China's air pollution puts public health at
risk every day because of the presence of minuscule particles known
as PM2.5. These are more prone to carrying a variety of toxic heavy
metals, acid oxides, organic pollutants, and other chemicals, as well
as micro-organisms such as bacteria and viruses in the air.</li>
<li>When inhaled the particles can enter the bloodstream and contribute
to a number of cardiovascular and respiratory problems, as well
increasing the risk of cancer.</li>
<li>The staggering contrast between good and bad air quality days have
shocked millions living both inside and outside of China.</li>
<li>Those living in Beijing who are seriously concerned about the effect
of air pollution are more likely to buy <strong>air-filtration masks, home
air-purifiers</strong>, and increasingly, devices known as &quot;laser eggs&quot;. The
portable dome-shaped machine monitors AQI levels <strong>in the immediate

<li><strong>While there are grounds to argue that</strong> it would benefit society
and young people themselves if teenagers were made to do unpaid work
in the community, <strong>it can equally be argued that</strong> this would be an
infringement of their rights. In this essay, I shall <strong>examine the
merits of both sides of the argument</strong> and state my own opinion.</li>
<li>In conclusion, I believe that <strong>while there are real merits on both
sides of the argument</strong>, the moral case against forcing young people
to work <strong>slightly outweighs any benefit to</strong> society. <strong>This is
reinforced by belief in the principle that</strong> childhood is a time for
education and fear of the danger of exploitation.</li>
<li>This essay will discuss both these views, before coming to the
conclusion that they are equally valid.</li>

<li>Education is the great equalizer, opening doors to lift themselves
out of poverty</li>
<li>It is a surprise to me to see educators stating that their
observation of homeschooled kids coming into public school are
universally negative.</li>
<li>But the public school structure is not the best fit for everyone, and
it is not generally conducive to encouraging creativity thinking,
inquiry, multi-perspective thinking.</li>
<li>How can you seriously foster learning in this environment of constant
bullying?</li>
<li>Some children do best in homeschooled environments, especially ones
that incorporate significant social interaction with peers as well as
informative adults and knowledgeable experts. Others may need more
structure, routine, or social averaging to feel most comfortable or
be most encouraged to pursue learning, whether that is a public
school, private school, or other institution.</li>
<li>To summarize, home schooled students can make friends through group
activities with other home schooled students, or through community
activities.</li>
<li>Students can progress at their own pace according to their strengths
and weaknesses without being labeled.</li>
<li>I think most people homeschool in response to the lack of quality
public schools and the expensive charter schools or other
alternatives.</li>
